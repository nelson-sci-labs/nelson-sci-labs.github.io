        <div class="about-content">
            <p>Bioinformatics lies at the intersection of biology and computer science and refers to the acquisition, analysis, distribution, and storage of biological data, including those data produced in large quantities from systems biology analyses such as metabolomics and proteomics. Bioinformatics emerged to in response to the need to manage large amounts of data generated by DNA, RNA, and peptide sequencing. With the development of additional systems biology platforms, including proteomics and metabolomics, bioinformatics has broadened and become more sophisticated and more integral than ever.

                    <p>Nelson Scientific Labs seeks a bioinformatician/data scientist with a strong background in biological sciences to support
                        big data analyses, prediction model-building, and custom software development capabilities for our federally funded
                        projects. The successful candidate holds a Master's degree in bioinformatics, biostatistics, computational biology,
                        computer science, or closely related discipline. The successful candidate also brings a sincere desire to learn, adapt to new
                        challenges, and develop novel approaches to harmonizing multiple large datasets used in medical device research and
                        
                        development. This position requires the incumbent have the ability to work independently or as part of a multi-
                        disciplinary team as well as a solid programming and analytical skill set, which includes competencies in R, Python, and
                        
                        database applications. Experience with metabolomics, lipidomics, proteomics, and/or transcriptomics is highly desirable.</p>

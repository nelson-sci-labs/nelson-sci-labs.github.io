                    <h3>Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)</h3>
                    <p>Exposure of victims to ionizing radiation due to a radiological accident or nuclear terrorism
                        leads
                        to the acute radiation syndrome. Since several efforts have led to the development of medical
                        countermeasures against these acute radiation toxicities, the chance that victims survive a
                        radiological
                        event has significantly increased. However, in victims who survive the acute effects, there will
                        be a latent
                        period of months to decades before delayed injuries manifest. Late organ injury is progressively
                        irreversible,
                        adversely affects quality of life and may prove life-threatening. Therefore, pre-emptive
                        identification of
                        individuals at risk for such late effects is critical in the decision process to determine the
                        timing and
                        choice of the most appropriate intervention strategies.</p>
                    <p class="p-text">In this project we will address this critical gap by leveraging murine models of
                        γ-ray
                        exposure to identify plasma and urine biomarkers that predict the extent of injury that will
                        manifest
                        in the heart and brain before clinical symptoms appear. FDA guidance on blood based biomarker
                        development
                        using “multi-omics” approaches will be followed to ensure regulatory considerations are taken
                        into account at all
                        steps in the process. The overall goal is to enable the selection of biomarker panels that would
                        be ready for
                        analytical validation for a kit-based assay in a subsequent Phase II application. These studies,
                        ultimately,
                        will enable the development of a commercially viable kit based companion diagnostic test that
                        can be used for
                        identifying individuals at risk for developing delayed injuries from radiation exposure.</p>

The Institution’s FCOI policy will specify the details of this disclosure, which will include, at a minimum, the purpose of the trip, the identity of the sponsor/organizer, the destination, and the duration. In accordance with the Institution’s FCOI policy, the institutional official(s) will determine if further information is needed, including a determination or disclosure of monetary value, in order to determine whether the travel constitutes an FCOI with the PHS-funded research.

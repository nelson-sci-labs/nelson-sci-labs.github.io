                    <h3>Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)</h3>
                    <p>Exposure of victims to ionizing radiation due to a radiological accident or nuclear terrorism
                        leads
                        to the acute radiation syndrome. Since several efforts have led to the development of medical
                        countermeasures against these acute radiation toxicities, the chance that victims survive a
                        radiological
                        event has significantly increased. However, in victims who survive the acute effects, there will
                        be a latent
                        period of months to decades before delayed injuries manifest. Late organ injury is progressively
                        irreversible,
                        adversely affects quality of life and may prove life-threatening. Therefore, pre-emptive
                        identification of
                        individuals at risk for such late effects is critical in the decision process to determine the
                        timing and
                        choice of the most appropriate intervention strategies.</p>
                    <p class="p-text">In this project we will address this critical gap by leveraging murine models of
                        γ-ray
                        exposure to identify plasma and urine biomarkers that predict the extent of injury that will
                        manifest
                        in the heart and brain before clinical symptoms appear. FDA guidance on blood based biomarker
                        development
                        using “multi-omics” approaches will be followed to ensure regulatory considerations are taken
                        into account at all
                        steps in the process. The overall goal is to enable the selection of biomarker panels that would
                        be ready for
                        analytical validation for a kit-based assay in a subsequent Phase II application. These studies,
                        ultimately,
                        will enable the development of a commercially viable kit based companion diagnostic test that
                        can be used for
                        identifying individuals at risk for developing delayed injuries from radiation exposure.</p>

                    <h3>CardioWatch: An Omics-Based Prediction Assay for Cardiac Late Effects of Acute Radiation</h3>
                    <p>A radiological emergency is an unanticipated situation involving human exposures to ionizing radiation from a radioactive source. 
                        These exposures may result in acute (early) and delayed (late) adverse health effects. 
                        Among the several known delayed effects associated with ionizing radiation is cardiovascular disease (CVD), w
                        hich may take months, years, or even decades to develop. There is currently no way to know after a radiological emergency who will develop radiation-induced CVD. 
                        The goal of this project is to develop CardioWatch, a medical diagnostic kit and MetaboWatch, 
                        a machine learning-based risk prediction software tool, together intended for use in estimating an individual’s risk for developing radiation-induced cardiovascular disease. 
                        The successful development of CardioWatch+MetaboWatch will be a first-in-kind achievement and will pioneer not only risk prediction for other radiation-induced outcomces but also the methodology for developing such state-of-the-art in vitro diagnostic medical devices.</p>

                            <br>
                            (2) NELSON SCIENTIFIC LABS will solicit and review disclosures of SFI(s) of all Investigators and their immediate family (including spouse/domestic partner and/or dependent children) related to the Investigator's institutional responsibilities. All Investigators will utilize the “Financial Disclosure Form for Investigators in PHS Research” to either disclose SFIs or declare that there are no SFI's.

                        <li>All Investigators and relevant NELSON SCIENTIFIC LABS personnel and collaborators are required to comply with this Policy in full. Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary or other appropriate action.</li>
                        <li>If an FCOI is not identified or managed in a timely manner (including Investigator failure to disclose SFI(s), NELSON SCIENTIFIC LABS's failure to review or manage FCOI(s), or failure to comply with the management plan), NELSON SCIENTIFIC LABS will within 120 days of the determination of noncompliance notify the NIH and submit a retrospective review, as per PHS FCOI Regulations. The retrospective review will include the following information: (a) Grant number; (b) Grant title; (c) PD/PI or contact PD/PI; (d) Name of Investigator with FCOI; (e) Name of entity with which Investigator has FCOI; (f) Reason(s) for retrospective review; (g) Detailed methodology used for retrospective review (e.g., details of review process, composition of the review panel, documents reviewed); (h) Findings and conclusions of the review; and (i) If warranted by the retrospective review, update and revise the previously submitted FCOI report.</li>

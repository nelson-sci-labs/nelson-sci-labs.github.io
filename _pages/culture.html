                    <h3>Our Culture</h3>
                    <p>At Nelson, our mission is to launch kit based biomarker assays as “In Vitro Diagnostics”
                        with the goal of identifying sub-populations at risk of developing pancreatic
                        cancer as well as those at risk of experiencing late effects following accidental
                        or therapeutic exposure to ionizing radiation. With these goal, we are setting out
                        to break barriers in the field of early detection. While we are aware that accomplishing
                        these goals is challenging and will require rigor, diligence, and expertise; we believe
                        that our team along with our strong academic partners can make a significant impact and
                        help improve clinical outcomes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-text">We have a deep, experienced, engaged multi-disciplinary team dedicated
                        towards improving and implementing novel study design and analytics for biomarker
                        development.
                        We have developed analytical pipelines for biomarker development in compliance with
                        biomarker qualification guidelines.
                        We are one of the first Biotech. company focused on the use of multi-omics approaches
                        for the development of IVDs for predicting radiation late effects and early detection of
                        pancreatic cancer
                        We are on our way to building a culture and a company focused on working collaboratively
                        to save lives and improve health outcomes.

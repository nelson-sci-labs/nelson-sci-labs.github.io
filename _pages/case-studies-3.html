            <h2>dentifying Biomarkers for Radiation-Induced Heart Disease in Cancer Survivors</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="about-content">
            <p><b>The Challenge</b>, Advancements in radiation therapy (RT) for cancer treatment have led to improved outcomes, but radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) remains a significant concern for cancer survivors. A lack of understanding of the natural history and mechanisms of RIHD development has prevented the development of diagnostic tests for clinical use. There is a need to explore the potential of metabolomics to identify cancer survivors at risk of developing cardiotoxicity after radiation therapy.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="p-text"><b>Nelson Scientific Labs Insight:</b> Nelson Scientific Labs recognized the potential of metabolomics and lipidomics to identify novel biomarkers associated with radiation-induced cardiac toxicity. By analyzing plasma and heart tissue samples from both animal models and human patients, they aimed to unveil metabolic alterations that could predict the risk of developing RIHD in cancer survivors.</p>

        <div class="about-content">
            <p><b>The Solution:</b> In collaboration with the research team, Nelson Scientific Labs analyzed plasma and left ventricle heart tissue samples from a cohort of male Sprague Dawley rats and plasma samples from patients receiving high-dose thoracic RT for esophageal cancer. Metabolomic and lipidomic analyses were used to identify metabolic alterations associated with radiation-induced cardiac toxicity. The team then developed classification algorithms based on these alterations to predict the risk of RIHD development in patients.</p>

        <div class="about-content">
            <p><b>The Outcome:</b> The study demonstrated the feasibility of developing a metabolomics-based biomarker panel associated with adverse outcomes of cardiac function in patients who received radiation therapy for esophageal cancer. The identified commonalities in radiation response, including steroid hormone biosynthesis and vitamin E metabolism, offer a foundation for further research into the mechanisms of RIHD development.

            <p class="p-text"><b>Insights:</b> By partnering with Nelson Scientific Labs, the research team was able to uncover novel insights into the potential biomarkers of radiation-induced heart disease, paving the way for improved diagnostic tools and preventive measures for cancer survivors receiving radiation therapy.

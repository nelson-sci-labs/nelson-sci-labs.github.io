            <p>Omics datasets are large and can seem overwhelming. Bringing a project through the data acquisition phase can be quite expensive. Therefore, it is best to extract as much value as possible from the resulting data. Furthermore, communicating relevant features in high-quality reports and manuscripts is essential. Each study is unique in its data and goals and deserves individual, custom attention. We at Nelson Scientific Labs are keenly focused on these phases of systems biology projects and are particularly eager to help bring your study to fruition.
